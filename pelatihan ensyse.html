    <p> I ranked Liquid Swords by GZA as Top 3 on my library. The reason being is that i found it being one of the best albums I've listened to. I say this as GZA is one of the best lyrical prolific rappers I've heard of so far. Such as the song <a href="https://youtu.be/SYr5DQkVLkM?si=Xvl6cACiw90cG9iM&t=102">The Spark</a> where GZA goes into detail about the creation of the universe. A specific lyric I chose was "Matter and antimatter, the arch-rival, Met, obliterated each other for survival"

       I rank Sean Price's Album <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3M8p6y5N6RE8iKSpoM8CMe?si=VXHJ4el9TsikMp9EUfCOiw">Mic Tyson</a> as number 2. The reason being of the song structure of 3 specific songs. Those being <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7fifwiZlUkN4h1V7Ahu3E8?si=d3074e76dcb746ec">Straight Music,</a> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3IvyttjgFqTLzojOddGVot?si=a176f58651d14e6f">Bar-Barian,</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0NknHNafFWgMRaVplKqLu8?si=51bf9862bfa549d1">The Genesis of The Omega</a>, The three songs have a primary piano presence within its composition. With Genesis of the Omega having a volatile intro with a piano being split and repeated in different sections of its traditional melody. But the album itself is a work of art in my opinion. The reason I say this is the variety of moods this album could suit. Such as the song <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1TwMtZTceqLHR3aAiqVCOx?si=223e7413938e4edc">BBQ Sauce</a> being a more of a comedic song in terms of lyrics as well as the music video that accompanies this song.

       <a> I ranked Ghostface Killah's Supreme Clientele as my number 1. The reason for this is because this album held many songs I enjoyed more than any of the previous albums. As 15 out of the total 21 including transitions I found to be quite enjoyable. For example, The song <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1SCicirSD5cfxrnOnDuKPD?si=f76ded61471e4420">Wu Banga 101</a>. The song begins with the already mentioned GZA. The line "I move with the speed and strength of ants" said by GZA stood out to me. As ants are known to be able to lift more and move faster relative to their own bodies compared to humans. It's lines like these I find interesting as instead of using simple lines, these lyrics reach out to facts and create a connection. Another song, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4wtQ5qLy8wxVsYk8avGfl7?si=793ba27fb7504f71">Malcolm</a>, starts with a sample of Malcolm X's last speech before his death. Followed with Ghostface making a reference to the infamous photo of Malcolm X standing by the door looking out the window. With the line being "I'm like Malcolm, out the window with the joint".
